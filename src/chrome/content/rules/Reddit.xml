	As of Aug. 2014, Reddit supports lots more SSL!
	We can probably prune some of the old static rules here.

	CDN buckets:

		- s3.amazonaws.com/reddit/
		- s3.amazonaws.com/redditads/
		- s3.amazonaws.com/static.reddit.com/
		- s3.amazonaws.com/(\w\.)?thumbs.redditmedia.com/
		- buttons.reddit.com.edgesuite.net


	Nonfunctional domains:

		- blog.reddit.com	(blogger)

		- pixel.redditmedia.com	(dropped)

			Seems some sort of ad tracking, possibly can be sent to /dev/null; didn't find
			anything broken when I blocked the domain.  Doesn't seem to be used anymore.

		- www.redditmedia.com	(refused)

			Seems only/mostly to be used for ads
